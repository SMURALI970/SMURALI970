   1       The relationship between product and product_category in the diagram provided follows many-to-one or many to one relationship [both are same].
           i.It can be identified by the foreign key ** "category_id"** as shown in the ER diagram 
   
   2       with  use of database constraints we can say that the given tables are valid.These are the database constraints
           i.Foreign key constraint
              The database enforces a foreign keyconstraint on the category idin the product table. This ensures that category_id must exist in product_category table.
          ii.Check constraint
             We can use this constraint as a query to check whether it is valid or not by processing the query
             Syntax:
              ALTER TABLE product
              ADD CONSTRAINT chk_vallid_category_id CHECK (category_id in select(id from category id);
